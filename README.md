SEC Scraping and Stock Price Prediction
Project descriptionWeb scraping presentation visualizing data from thousands of reports in the SEC database.
Utilized machine learning on price data from thousands of stocks to make price predictions.

Details:

Created an automated data scraping and preprocessing tool, persistently collected and cleaned up unstructured data from hundreds of sources to structured data with Python, enhancing the work efficiency by 30%

Built automated data system and clean data pipelines, managed proprietary data and unstructured external open sources data into pandas database, improved the data integrity by 25%

Extracted data from Pandas database and performed exploratory data analysis and interpreted data using statistical models in Sklearn, and provided report to help the team understand the stock's/secâ€™s info data, prepared dataset for the model building

Calculated stock indicators and developed machine learning models and statistical models to predict future price movement with 70% accuracy.

Tech: Unstructured Data, Automation, Random Forests, SKlearn Modelling and Visualization, Stock Indicators, Scraping/Beautiful Soup, Mitigation of Overfitting, Supervised ML
